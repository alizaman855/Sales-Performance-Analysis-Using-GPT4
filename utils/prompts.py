    - **Tours Booked**: {sales_data_row['tours_booked']}
    - **Applications Submitted**: {sales_data_row['applications']}
    - **Tours per Lead**: {sales_data_row['tours_per_lead']}
    - **Applications per Tour**: {sales_data_row['apps_per_tour']}
    - **Applications per Lead**: {sales_data_row['apps_per_lead']}
    - **Confirmed Revenue**: ${sales_data_row['revenue_confirmed']}

    3. **Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement**: Identify any areas where the representative could improve. This could include things like lead generation, applications, or tours. Provide suggestions on how to improve performance in these areas, such as strategies for better lead nurturing or conversion techniques.

    4. **Comparison to Team Performance**: Compare the representativeâ€™s key metrics (leads, applications, revenue) with the average team performance. Explain whether the representative is outperforming or underperforming compared to their peers.

    5. **Suggested Actions**:
        - **Lead Generation Strategies**: If the representative is behind in lead generation, recommend strategies for improving lead acquisition. This may include specific outreach techniques, networking strategies, or the use of lead generation tools.
        - **Sales Funnel Optimization**: Suggest ways the representative could improve the conversion of leads to applications or booked tours. For example, focusing on follow-ups, better qualification of leads, or improving tour presentations.

    6. **General Sales Strategy**: Provide high-level suggestions that the sales representative can incorporate into their day-to-day work to improve overall performance. This could include time management techniques, pipeline management, or team collaboration.

    Based on this data, please give a thorough analysis of the representative's performance, comparing it with team averages, and provide actionable insights for improving future performance.
